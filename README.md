## The API used was for "Air Quality Index" (AQI)

- Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500.
- The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.
- For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.

## What you can do with the app

- Pull pollution info from API
- Be able to see the pollution in any city at any time
- Save favorite cities
- Check weather details in a city
